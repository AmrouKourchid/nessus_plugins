"The Nutanix AHV host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities .");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"The version of AHV installed on the remote host is prior to 20201105.1045. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AHV-20201105.1045 advisory.

  - A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way sudo parses command line arguments. This flaw is
    exploitable by any local user who can execute the sudo command without authentication. Successful
    exploitation of this flaw could lead to privilege escalation.  (CVE-2021-3156)

  - Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which
    allows privilege escalation to root via sudoedit -s and a command-line argument that ends with a single
    backslash character. (CVE-2021-3156)

  - Net-SNMP through 5.8 has Improper Privilege Management because SNMP WRITE access to the EXTEND MIB
    provides the ability to run arbitrary commands as root. (CVE-2020-15862)

  - A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq
    checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if the reply destination address/port is used by the pending
    forwarded queries. However, it does not use the address/port to retrieve the exact forwarded query,
    substantially reducing the number of attempts an attacker on the network would have to perform to forge a
    reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies a query's
    attributes that all must be used to match a reply. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a DNS Cache
    Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity of a successful
    attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity. (CVE-2020-25684)

  - A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq
    checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is the forwarded query that matches the reply, by only using a
    weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1
    when it is) this flaw allows an off-path attacker to find several different domains all having the same
    hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts they would have to perform to forge a reply and get it
    accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is one of the
    attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache
    Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.
    The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity. (CVE-2020-25685)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.");
