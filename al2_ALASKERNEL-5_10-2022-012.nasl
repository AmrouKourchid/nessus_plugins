    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    mm/damon/dbgfs: fix 'struct pid' leaks in 'dbgfs_target_ids_write()' (CVE-2021-46937)

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    mm/damon/dbgfs: protect targets destructions with kdamond_lock (CVE-2021-47088)

    A flaw was found in unrestricted eBPF usage by the BPF_BTF_LOAD, leading to a possible out-of-bounds
    memory write in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem due to the way a user loads BTF. This flaw allows a local
    user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-0500)

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write().
    This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2022-1011)

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem.
    This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue. (CVE-2022-1015)

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which can cause a
    use-after-free. This issue needs to handle return with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel
    information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker. (CVE-2022-1016)

    Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV
    device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways
    being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious
    backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the
    gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they
    assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the
    backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access
    to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.
    The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of
    a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038
    gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus,
    9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no
    longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted
    access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then
    re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to
    revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which
    can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042 (CVE-2022-23036)

    The Amazon Linux kernel now enables, by default, a software mitigation for this issue, on all ARM-based
    EC2 instance types. (CVE-2022-23960)

    An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in nft_fwd_dup_netdev_offload in
    net/netfilter/nf_dup_netdev.c in the netfilter subcomponent in the Linux kernel due to a heap out-of-
    bounds write problem. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access
    to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a privilege escalation threat. (CVE-2022-25636)

    A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c and
    net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap
    objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat. (CVE-2022-27666)
