patch available.

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: audit: improve robustness of the audit
    queue handling If the audit daemon were ever to get stuck in a stopped state the kernel's kauditd_thread()
    could get blocked attempting to send audit records to the userspace audit daemon. With the kernel thread
    blocked it is possible that the audit queue could grow unbounded as certain audit record generating events
    must be exempt from the queue limits else the system enter a deadlock state. This patch resolves this
    problem by lowering the kernel thread's socket sending timeout from MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT to HZ/10 and
    tweaks the kauditd_send_queue() function to better manage the various audit queues when connection
    problems occur between the kernel and the audit daemon. With this patch, the backlog may temporarily grow
    beyond the defined limits when the audit daemon is stopped and the system is under heavy audit pressure,
    but kauditd_thread() will continue to make progress and drain the queues as it would for other connection
    problems. For example, with the audit daemon put into a stopped state and the system configured to audit
    every syscall it was still possible to shutdown the system without a kernel panic, deadlock, etc.;
    granted, the system was slow to shutdown but that is to be expected given the extreme pressure of
    recording every syscall. The timeout value of HZ/10 was chosen primarily through experimentation and this
    developer's gut feeling. There is likely no one perfect value, but as this scenario is limited in scope
    (root privileges would be needed to send SIGSTOP to the audit daemon), it is likely not worth exposing
    this as a tunable at present. This can always be done at a later date if it proves necessary.
