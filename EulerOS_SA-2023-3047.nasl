"The remote EulerOS host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the linux-sgx packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected
by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient
    to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
    decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.
    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS
    connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An
    attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
    trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number
    of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be
    able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. (CVE-2022-4304)

  - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the 'name' (e.g.
    'CERTIFICATE'), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the 'name_out',
    'header' and 'data' arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.
    The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results
    in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate
    the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this
    buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an
    attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service
    attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and
    therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a
    number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()
    which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the
    caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
    include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL
    asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue. (CVE-2022-4450)

  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is
    primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may
    also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a
    new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the
    BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,
    the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this
    case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal
    pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then
    a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the
    internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call
    BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
    PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,
    SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
    i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL
    cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. (CVE-2023-0215)

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

  - A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the
    verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit
    this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of
    computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy
    processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line
    utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function. (CVE-2023-0464)

  - Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from
    a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are
    silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate. A
    malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent
    policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled
    by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
    `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function. (CVE-2023-0465)

  - The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy
    check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the
    check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.
    As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing
    behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to
    perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the
    policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.
    Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.
    (CVE-2023-0466)

  - Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or data containing them may be
    very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL
    subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to
    very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service. An OBJECT
    IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.
    OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the
    OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT
    IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods. When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the
    translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n'
    being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*). With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic
    algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs
    in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms. Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be
    received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to
    specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest
    passed data. Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any
    version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low. In
    OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts
    anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature. The
    impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's
    certificate chain. Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
    authentication. In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509
    certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of Service, so
    these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
    and the severity is therefore considered low. (CVE-2023-2650)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
    or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
    obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter
    value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if
    present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if
    q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an
    untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function DH_check() is itself
    called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
    similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().
    Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check'
    option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS
    providers are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-3817)
