patch available.

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA: pcm: Fix potential AB/BA lock
    with buffer_mutex and mmap_lock syzbot caught a potential deadlock between the PCM runtime->buffer_mutex
    and the mm->mmap_lock. It was brought by the recent fix to cover the racy read/write and other ioctls, and
    in that commit, I overlooked a (hopefully only) corner case that may take the revert lock, namely, the OSS
    mmap. The OSS mmap operation exceptionally allows to re-configure the parameters inside the OSS mmap
    syscall, where mm->mmap_mutex is already held. Meanwhile, the copy_from/to_user calls at read/write
    operations also take the mm->mmap_lock internally, hence it may lead to a AB/BA deadlock. A similar
    problem was already seen in the past and we fixed it with a refcount (in commit b248371628aa). The former
    fix covered only the call paths with OSS read/write and OSS ioctls, while we need to cover the concurrent
    access via both ALSA and OSS APIs now. This patch addresses the problem above by replacing the
    buffer_mutex lock in the read/write operations with a refcount similar as we've used for OSS. The new
    field, runtime->buffer_accessing, keeps the number of concurrent read/write operations. Unlike the former
    buffer_mutex protection, this protects only around the copy_from/to_user() calls; the other codes are
    basically protected by the PCM stream lock. The refcount can be a negative, meaning blocked by the ioctls.
    If a negative value is seen, the read/write aborts with -EBUSY. In the ioctl side, OTOH, they check this
    refcount, too, and set to a negative value for blocking unless it's already being accessed.
