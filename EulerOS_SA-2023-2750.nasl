"The remote EulerOS Virtualization host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the curl packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host is
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl <8.0 during communication using the TELNET protocol may
    allow an attacker to pass on maliciously crafted user name and 'telnet options' during server negotiation.
    The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send content or perform option negotiation
    without the application's intent. This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user
    input, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system. (CVE-2023-27533)

  - A path traversal vulnerability exists in curl <8.0.0 SFTP implementation causes the tilde (~) character to
    be wrongly replaced when used as a prefix in the first path element, in addition to its intended use as
    the first element to indicate a path relative to the user's home directory. Attackers can exploit this
    flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a
    server with a specific user. (CVE-2023-27534)

  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the FTP connection reuse feature that
    can result in wrong credentials being used during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are
    kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as
    CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not
    included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl
    using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to
    sensitive information. (CVE-2023-27535)

  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists libcurl <8.0.0 in the connection reuse feature which can
    reuse previously established connections with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for
    changes in the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI
    transfers and could potentially result in unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option
    is to not reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed. (CVE-2023-27536)

  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl prior to v8.0.0 where it reuses a previously
    established SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH option was modified, which should have prevented
    reuse. libcurl maintains a pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers if
    the configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from the configuration check, allowing
    them to match easily, potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection. (CVE-2023-27538)

  - An improper certificate validation vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way it supports matching of
    wildcard patterns when listed as 'Subject Alternative Name' in TLS server certificates. curl can be built
    to use its own name matching function for TLS rather than one provided by a TLS library. This private
    wildcard matching function would match IDN (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a
    result accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch. IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before
    used for certificate checks. Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to
    pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though
    the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`. (CVE-2023-28321)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might
    erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the
    `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously wasused to issue a `PUT` request
    which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send
    off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. The problem exists in the
    logic for a reused handle when it is (expected to be) changed from a PUT to a POST. (CVE-2023-28322)
