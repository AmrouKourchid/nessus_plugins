  - PAC parsing in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.19.4 and 1.20.x before 1.20.1 has integer overflows that
    may lead to remote code execution (in KDC, kadmind, or a GSS or Kerberos application server) on 32-bit
    platforms (which have a resultant heap-based buffer overflow), and cause a denial of service on other
    platforms. This occurs in krb5_pac_parse in lib/krb5/krb/pac.c. Heimdal before 7.7.1 has a similar bug.

  - Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or data containing them may be
    very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL
    subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to
    very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service. An OBJECT
    IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.
    OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the
    OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT
    IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods. When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the
    translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n'
    being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*). With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic
    algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs
    in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms. Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be
    received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to
    specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest
    passed data. Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any
    version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low. In
    OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts
    anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature. The
    impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's
    certificate chain. Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
    authentication. In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509
    certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of Service, so
    these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
    and the severity is therefore considered low. (CVE-2023-2650)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
    or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
    obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter
    value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if
    present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if
    q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an
    untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function DH_check() is itself
    called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
    similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().
    Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the -check
    option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS
    providers are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-3817)

  - This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. When curl is asked to
    pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting
    done by curl itself, the maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes. If the host name is detected
    to be longer, curl switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due
    to this bug, the local variable that means let the host resolve the name could get the wrong value
    during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long host name to the target
    buffer instead of copying just the resolved address there. The target buffer being a heap based buffer,
    and the host name coming from the URL that curl has been told to operate with. (CVE-2023-38545)

  - CVE-2023-38545 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake in libcurl and
    curl.  When curl is given a hostname to pass along to a SOCKS5 proxy that is greater than 255 bytes in
    length, it will switch to local name resolution in order to resolve the address before passing it on to
    the SOCKS5 proxy. However, due to a bug introduced in 2020, this local name resolution could fail due to a
    slow SOCKS5 handshake, causing curl to pass on the hostname greater than 255 bytes in length into the
    target buffer, leading to a heap overflow.  The advisory for CVE-2023-38545 gives an example exploitation
    scenario of a malicious HTTPS server redirecting to a specially crafted URL. While it might seem that an
    attacker would need to influence the slowness of the SOCKS5 handshake, the advisory states that server
    latency is likely slow enough to trigger this bug. (CVE-2023-38545)
