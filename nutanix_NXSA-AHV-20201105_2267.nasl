"The version of AHV installed on the remote host is prior to 20201105.2267. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AHV-20201105.2267 advisory.

  - NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a heap overflow
    when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures
    encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely to be impacted. Applications using NSS for
    certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how
    they configure NSS. *Note: This vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and
    PDF viewers that use NSS for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and
    Evince are believed to be impacted. This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS < 3.68.1.
    (CVE-2021-43527)

  - An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm in the Unicode Specification through 14.0. It
    permits the visual reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to craft source code
    that renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and interpreters.
    Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode such that targeted
    vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the
    following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of
    international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the
    Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior when text includes left-to-
    right and right-to-left characters, the visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order.
    Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements of bidirectional text can
    further obfuscate the logical order of tokens. Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such
    that the ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will be processed by a
    compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in its
    document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also
    provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode
    Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the
    BIDI specification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways that can mitigate misleading
    visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.
    (CVE-2021-42574)

  - AIDE before 0.17.4 allows local users to obtain root privileges via crafted file metadata (such as XFS
    extended attributes or tmpfs ACLs), because of a heap-based buffer overflow. (CVE-2021-45417)

  - A flaw was found in RPM's signature check functionality when reading a package file. This flaw allows an
    attacker who can convince a victim to install a seemingly verifiable package, whose signature header was
    modified, to cause RPM database corruption and execute code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability. (CVE-2021-20271)

  - The Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.18.5 and 1.19.x before 1.19.3 has
    a NULL pointer dereference in kdc/do_tgs_req.c via a FAST inner body that lacks a server field.
    (CVE-2021-37750)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
