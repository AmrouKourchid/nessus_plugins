  - Matrix JavaScript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server software development kit (SDK) for JavaScript. Prior to
    version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could interfere with the verification
    flow between two users, injecting its own cross-signing user identity in place of one of the users'
    identities. This would lead to the other device trusting/verifying the user identity under the control of
    the homeserver instead of the intended one. The vulnerability is a bug in the matrix-js-sdk, caused by
    checking and signing user identities and devices in two separate steps, and inadequately fixing the keys
    to be signed between those steps. Even though the attack is partly made possible due to the design
    decision of treating cross-signing user identities as Matrix devices on the server side (with their device
    ID set to the public part of the user identity key), no other examined implementations were vulnerable.
    Starting with version 19.7.0, the matrix-js-sdk has been modified to double check that the key signed is
    the one that was verified instead of just referencing the key by ID. An additional check has been made to
    report an error when one of the device ID matches a cross-signing key. As this attack requires
    coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker, those who trust their homeservers do not need
    a particular workaround. (CVE-2022-39250)

Note that Nessus relies on the presence of the package as reported by the vendor.");
