  - Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied
    by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example
    out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such
    as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error()
    to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by
    OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most
    applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be
    totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend
    on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses.
    This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause
    X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur
    where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate
    Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two
    issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1
    (Affected 3.0.0). (CVE-2021-4044)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - c_rehash script allows command injection (CVE-2022-1292)

  - Signer certificate verification returned inaccurate response when using OCSP_NOCHECKS (CVE-2022-1343)

  - OPENSSL_LH_flush() breaks reuse of memory (CVE-2022-1473)

  - the c_rehash script allows command injection (CVE-2022-2068)

  - AES OCB fails to encrypt some bytes on 32-bit x86 (CVE-2022-2097)

  - X.509 Email Address Buffer Overflow (CVE-2022-3602, CVE-2022-3786)

  - A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint
    checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
    have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite
    failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which
    could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private
    memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working
    exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client,
    this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the
    server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. (CVE-2022-4203)

  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient
    to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
    decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.
    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS
    connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An
    attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
    trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number
    of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be
    able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. (CVE-2022-4304)

  - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the name (e.g.
    CERTIFICATE), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the name_out,
    header and data arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.
    The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results
    in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate
    the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this
    buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an
    attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service
    attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and
    therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a
    number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()
    which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the
    caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
    include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL
    asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue. (CVE-2022-4450)

  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is
    primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may
    also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a
    new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the
    BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,
    the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this
    case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal
    pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then
    a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the
    internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call
    BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
    PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,
    SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
    i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL
    cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. (CVE-2023-0215)

  - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7
    data with the d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the dereference is
    an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL
    does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.
    (CVE-2023-0216)

  - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA
    public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash.
    This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker
    to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but
    applications might call the function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards
    such as FIPS 140-3. (CVE-2023-0217)

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

  - A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or
    signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library
    but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There
    is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
    usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused
    by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.
    PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS
    implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications would be affected
    if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data. (CVE-2023-0401)
