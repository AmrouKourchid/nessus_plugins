"The remote EulerOS Virtualization host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem.
    This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue. (CVE-2022-1015)

  - An out-of-bounds(OOB) memory access vulnerability was found in vmwgfx driver in
    drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_kms.c in GPU component in the Linux kernel with device file '/dev/dri/renderD128
    (or Dxxx)'. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain privilege, causing
    a denial of service(DoS). (CVE-2022-36280)

  - A double-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP device driver functionality in how a user
    registers the device when the register_netdevice function fails (NETDEV_REGISTER notifier). This flaw
    allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-4744)

  - A speculative pointer dereference problem exists in the Linux Kernel on the do_prlimit() function. The
    resource argument value is controlled and is used in pointer arithmetic for the 'rlim' variable and can be
    used to leak the contents. We recommend upgrading past version 6.1.8 or commit
    739790605705ddcf18f21782b9c99ad7d53a8c11 (CVE-2023-0458)

  - Copy_from_user on 64-bit versions of the Linux kernel does not implement the __uaccess_begin_nospec
    allowing a user to bypass the 'access_ok' check and pass a kernel pointer to copy_from_user(). This would
    allow an attacker to leak information. We recommend upgrading beyond commit
    74e19ef0ff8061ef55957c3abd71614ef0f42f47 (CVE-2023-0459)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's core dump subsystem. This flaw allows a local user
    to crash the system. Only if patch 390031c94211 ('coredump: Use the vma snapshot in fill_files_note') not
    applied yet, then kernel could be affected. (CVE-2023-1249)

  - Use After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege
    Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-
    after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this
    vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git
    commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2. (CVE-2023-1281)

  - A flaw was found in KVM. When calling the KVM_GET_DEBUGREGS ioctl, on 32-bit systems, there might be some
    uninitialized portions of the kvm_debugregs structure that could be copied to userspace, causing an
    information leak. (CVE-2023-1513)

  - A flaw that boot CPU could be vulnerable for the speculative execution behavior kind of attacks in the
    Linux kernel X86 CPU Power management options functionality was found in the way user resuming CPU from
    suspend-to-RAM. A local user could use this flaw to potentially get unauthorized access to some memory of
    the CPU similar to the speculative execution behavior kind of attacks. (CVE-2023-1637)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in vhost_net_set_backend in drivers/vhost/net.c in virtio network
    subcomponent in the Linux kernel due to a double fget. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the
    system, and could even lead to a kernel information leak problem. (CVE-2023-1838)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring system can be exploited to achieve local
    privilege escalation. The io_file_get_fixed function lacks the presence of ctx->uring_lock which can lead
    to a Use-After-Free vulnerability due a race condition with fixed files getting unregistered. We recommend
    upgrading past commit da24142b1ef9fd5d36b76e36bab328a5b27523e8. (CVE-2023-1872)

  - The Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by calling prctl with
    PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculation feature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed
    that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to
    attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be
    observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line. This happened
    because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that
    STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection.
    However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons,
    which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target
    injection against which STIBP protects. (CVE-2023-1998)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's udmabuf device driver. The specific flaw exists within a fault
    handler. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a
    memory access past the end of an array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges
    and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. (CVE-2023-2008)

  - An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's XFS file system in how a user restores
    an XFS image after failure (with a dirty log journal). This flaw allows a local user to crash or
    potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-2124)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in iscsi_sw_tcp_session_create in drivers/scsi/iscsi_tcp.c in
    SCSI sub-component in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw an attacker could leak kernel internal information.
    (CVE-2023-2162)

  - A vulnerability was found in compare_netdev_and_ip in drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c in RDMA in the Linux
    Kernel. The improper cleanup results in out-of-boundary read, where a local user can utilize this problem
    to crash the system or escalation of privilege. (CVE-2023-2176)

  - A null pointer dereference issue was found in the sctp network protocol in net/sctp/stream_sched.c in
    Linux Kernel. If stream_in allocation is failed, stream_out is freed which would further be accessed. A
    local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2023-2177)

  - An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device driver. The
    userspace 'data->block[0]' variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a
    memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a local privileged user to
    crash the system or potentially achieve code execution. (CVE-2023-2194)

  - Rejected reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority because it was
    the duplicate of CVE-2023-31436. (CVE-2023-2248)

  - A denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a
    deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-
    component. (CVE-2023-2269)

  - Rejected reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2023-33203. Reason: This candidate is a
    reservation duplicate of CVE-2023-33203. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2023-33203 instead of
    this candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental
    usage. (CVE-2023-2483)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem in the way it handled the
    extra inode size for extended attributes. This flaw could allow a privileged local user to cause a system
    crash or other undefined behaviors. (CVE-2023-2513)

  - do_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6 lacks a lock_sock call, leading
    to a race condition (with a resultant use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference). (CVE-2023-28466)

  - An issue was discovered in arch/x86/kvm/vmx/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.8. nVMX on x86_64
    lacks consistency checks for CR0 and CR4. (CVE-2023-30456)

  - qfq_change_class in net/sched/sch_qfq.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.13 allows an out-of-bounds write
    because lmax can exceed QFQ_MIN_LMAX. (CVE-2023-31436)

  - In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests
    can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users
    can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled. (CVE-2023-32233)

  - The Linux kernel before 6.2.9 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in
    drivers/net/ethernet/qualcomm/emac/emac.c if a physically proximate attacker unplugs an emac based device.
