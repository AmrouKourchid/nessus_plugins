"The remote SUSE Linux SLES15 / SLES_SAP15 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as
referenced in the SUSE-SU-2022:3998-1 advisory.

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's pipes functionality in how a user performs
    manipulations with the pipe post_one_notification() after free_pipe_info() that is already called. This
    flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-1882)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM when attempting to set a SynIC IRQ. This issue makes it
    possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This
    flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel
    oops condition that results in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-2153)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet
    Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes.
    (CVE-2022-2964)

  - A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel NILFS file system was found in the way user triggers function
    security_inode_alloc to fail with following call to function nilfs_mdt_destroy. A local user could use
    this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-2978)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A denial of service flaw may occur if there is a consecutive request
    of the NVME_IOCTL_RESET and the NVME_IOCTL_SUBSYS_RESET through the device file of the driver, resulting
    in a PCIe link disconnect. (CVE-2022-3169)

  - drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of
    a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function.
    (CVE-2022-33981)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SGI GRU driver in the way the first
    gru_file_unlocked_ioctl function is called by the user, where a fail pass occurs in the
    gru_check_chiplet_assignment function. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate
    their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-3424)

  - A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function
    fib_nh_match of the file net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c of the component IPv4 Handler. The manipulation leads to
    out-of-bounds read. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to
    fix this issue. The identifier VDB-210357 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3435)

  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects
    the function kcm_tx_work of the file net/kcm/kcmsock.c of the component kcm. The manipulation leads to
    race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211018 is the identifier
    assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3521)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this
    vulnerability is the function ipv6_renew_options of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to
    memory leak. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
    The identifier VDB-211021 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3524)

    This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It is in
    bigben_probe of drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c. The reason is incorrect assumption - bigben devices all have
    inputs. However, malicious devices can break this assumption, leaking to out-of-bound write.
    (CVE-2022-3577)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb
    enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed)
