Modicon M241/M251 firmware Version 5.2.11.29 includes a fix for this vulnerability and can be updated through the
Schneider Electric SoftwareUpdate (SESU) application that is part of EcoStruxure Machine Expert

Update Modicon Controller M241/M251 to the latest firmware by using Controller Assistant and perform reboot. Users
should employ appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. Schneider Electric
strongly recommends the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a test and development environment
or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric's Customer Care Center for assistance removing a patch.

Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all future versions of Modicon M258/LMC058 that will include a
fix for this vulnerability. They will update SEVD-2024-345-03 when the remediation is available. Until then, users
should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

- Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not
accessible from public Internet or untrusted networks.
- Filter ports and IP through the embedded firewall.
- Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Port 502/TCP.
- Disable all unused protocols (default configuration).
- For more details refer to 'Cybersecurity Guidelines for EcoStruxure Machine Expert, Modicon and PacDrive Controllers
and Associated Equipment Guide'
- To ensure users are informed of all updates, including details on affected products and remediation plans, Schneider
Electric recommends subscription to their security notification service.

Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:

- Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business
network.
- Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems,
components, peripheral equipment, and networks.
- Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the 'Program' mode.
- Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
- Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the
terminals or any node connected to these networks.
- Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the
safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
- Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the
Internet.
- When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may
have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as
secure as the connected devices.
- For more information refer to the Schneider Electric recommended cybersecurity best practices document.
