"The version of tigervnc installed on the remote host is prior to 1.12.0 / 1.13.1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the SSA:2023-317-01 advisory.

  - A vulnerability classified as critical was found in X.org Server. Affected by this vulnerability is the
    function _GetCountedString of the file xkb/xkb.c. The manipulation leads to buffer overflow. It is
    recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is
    VDB-211051. (CVE-2022-3550)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in X.org Server. Affected by this
    issue is the function ProcXkbGetKbdByName of the file xkb/xkb.c. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It
    is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211052.
    (CVE-2022-3551)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in X.org Server. This affects an unknown
    part of the file hw/xquartz/X11Controller.m of the component xquartz. The manipulation leads to denial of
    service. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211053 was assigned to
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3553)

  - A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs because the XkbCopyNames function left a
    dangling pointer to freed memory, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access on subsequent XkbGetKbdByName
    requests.. This issue can lead to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running
    privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions. (CVE-2022-4283)

  - A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs becuase the swap handler for the
    XTestFakeInput request of the XTest extension may corrupt the stack if GenericEvents with lengths larger
    than 32 bytes are sent through a the XTestFakeInput request. This issue can lead to local privileges
    elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for ssh X
    forwarding sessions. This issue does not affect systems where client and server use the same byte order.
    (CVE-2022-46340)

  - A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs because the handler for the XIPassiveUngrab
    request accesses out-of-bounds memory when invoked with a high keycode or button code. This issue can lead
    to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code
    execution for ssh X forwarding sessions. (CVE-2022-46341)

  - A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs because the handler for the
    XvdiSelectVideoNotify request may write to memory after it has been freed. This issue can lead to local
    privileges elevation on systems where the X se (CVE-2022-46342)

  - A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs because the handler for the
    ScreenSaverSetAttributes request may write to memory after it has been freed. This issue can lead to local
    privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for ssh
    X forwarding sessions. (CVE-2022-46343)

  - A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs because the handler for the XIChangeProperty
    request has a length-validation issues, resulting in out-of-bounds memory reads and potential information
    disclosure. This issue can lead to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running
    privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions. (CVE-2022-46344)

  - A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This issue occurs due to a dangling pointer in DeepCopyPointerClasses
    that can be exploited by ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo() and ProcXkbGetDeviceInfo() to read and write into freed
    memory. This can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server runs privileged and
    remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions. (CVE-2023-0494)

  - A flaw was found in X.Org Server Overlay Window. A Use-After-Free may lead to local privilege escalation.
    If a client explicitly destroys the compositor overlay window (aka COW), the Xserver would leave a
    dangling pointer to that window in the CompScreen structure, which will trigger a use-after-free later.
    (CVE-2023-1393)

  - A out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the xorg-x11-server. This issue occurs due to an incorrect
    calculation of a buffer offset when copying data stored in the heap in the XIChangeDeviceProperty function
    in Xi/xiproperty.c and in RRChangeOutputProperty function in randr/rrproperty.c, allowing for possible
    escalation of privileges or denial of service. (CVE-2023-5367)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the xorg-x11-server. An X server crash may occur in a very specific and
    legacy configuration (a multi-screen setup with multiple protocol screens, also known as Zaphod mode) if
    the pointer is warped from within a window on one screen to the root window of the other screen and if the
    original window is destroyed followed by another window being destroyed. (CVE-2023-5380)
