"The remote EulerOS Virtualization host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c has a
    .disconnect versus dvb_device_open race condition that leads to a use-after-free. (CVE-2022-45886)

  - A hash collision flaw was found in the IPv6 connection lookup table in the Linux kernel's IPv6
    functionality when a user makes a new kind of SYN flood attack. A user located in the local network or
    with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up
    to 95%. (CVE-2023-1206)

  - In multiple functions of binder.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation. (CVE-2023-21255)

  - A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DECnet networking protocol. This issue
    could allow a remote user to crash the system. (CVE-2023-3338)

  - A null pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) driver. This issue
    could allow a local user to crash the system. (CVE-2023-3358)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem in
    net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. Mishandled error handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE makes it possible to use a
    dangling pointer in the same transaction causing a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local
    attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue. We recommend upgrading past commit
    1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97. (CVE-2023-3390)

  - The fix for XSA-423 added logic to Linux'es netback driver to deal with a frontend splitting a packet in a
    way such that not all of the headers would come in one piece. Unfortunately the logic introduced there
    didn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet being split into as many pieces as permitted by
    the protocol, yet still being smaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all (possible)
    headers together. Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger a buffer overrun in the driver.
    (CVE-2023-34319)

  - Linux Kernel nftables Out-Of-Bounds Read/Write Vulnerability; nft_byteorder poorly handled vm register
    contents when CAP_NET_ADMIN is in any user or network namespace (CVE-2023-35001)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to
    achieve local privilege escalation. If tcf_change_indev() fails, u32_set_parms() will immediately return
    an error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can
    control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a
    use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 04c55383fa5689357bcdd2c8036725a55ed632bc.
    (CVE-2023-3609)

  - An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited
    to achieve local privilege escalation. The qfq_change_agg() function in net/sched/sch_qfq.c allows an out-
    of-bounds write because lmax is updated according to packet sizes without bounds checks. We recommend
    upgrading past commit 3e337087c3b5805fe0b8a46ba622a962880b5d64. (CVE-2023-3611)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue
    may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to directly dereference a NULL pointer in
    xfrm_update_ae_params(), leading to a possible kernel crash and denial of service. (CVE-2023-3772)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to
    achieve local privilege escalation. If tcf_change_indev() fails, fw_set_parms() will immediately return an
    error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can
    control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a
    use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 0323bce598eea038714f941ce2b22541c46d488f.
    (CVE-2023-3776)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in nfc_llcp_find_local in net/nfc/llcp_core.c in NFC in the Linux kernel.
    This flaw allows a local user with special privileges to impact a kernel information leak issue.
    (CVE-2023-3863)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the siano smsusb module in the Linux kernel. The bug occurs
    during device initialization when the siano device is plugged in. This flaw allows a local user to crash
    the system, causing a denial of service condition. (CVE-2023-4132)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to
    bypass network filters and gain unauthorized access to some resources. The original patches fixing
    CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits -
    a096ccca6e50 ('tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid'), - 66b2c338adce ('tap: tap_open():
    correctly initialize socket uid'), pass 'inode->i_uid' to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and
    that turns out to not be accurate. (CVE-2023-4194)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system
    (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing
    sanity check. (CVE-2023-4385)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in
    VMware's vmxnet3 ethernet NIC driver in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash
    the system due to a double-free while cleaning up vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all, which could also lead to a
    kernel information leak problem. (CVE-2023-4387)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in
    the networking sub-component in vmxnet3 in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with
    normal user privilege to cause a denial of service due to a missing sanity check during cleanup.
