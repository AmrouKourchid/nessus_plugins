"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - It was found that cephx authentication protocol did not verify ceph clients correctly and was vulnerable
    to replay attack. Any attacker having access to ceph cluster network who is able to sniff packets on
    network can use this vulnerability to authenticate with ceph service and perform actions allowed by ceph
    service. Ceph branches master, mimic, luminous and jewel are believed to be vulnerable. (CVE-2018-1128)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel, version kernel-2.6.32, in
    Marvell WiFi chip driver. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly
    execute arbitrary code, when the lbs_ibss_join_existing function is called after a STA connects to an AP.
    (CVE-2019-14896)

  - A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel, version kernel-2.6.32, in Marvell WiFi chip
    driver. An attacker is able to cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary
    code, when a STA works in IBSS mode (allows connecting stations together without the use of an AP) and
    connects to another STA. (CVE-2019-14897)

  - fs/btrfs/volumes.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1 allows a btrfs_verify_dev_extents NULL pointer
    dereference via a crafted btrfs image because fs_devices->devices is mishandled within find_device, aka
    CID-09ba3bc9dd15. (CVE-2019-18885)

  - __btrfs_free_extent in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.12 calls btrfs_print_leaf in
    a certain ENOENT case, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information about register
    values via the dmesg program. NOTE: The BTRFS development team disputes this issues as not being a
    vulnerability because 1) The kernel provide facilities to restrict access to dmesg - dmesg_restrict=1
    sysctl option. So it's really up to the system administrator to judge whether dmesg access shall be
    disallowed or not. 2) WARN/WARN_ON are widely used macros in the linux kernel. If this CVE is considered
    valid this would mean there are literally thousands CVE lurking in the kernel - something which clearly is
    not the case. (CVE-2019-19039)

  - In the Android kernel in sync debug fs driver there is a kernel pointer leak due to the usage of printf
    with %p. This could lead to local information disclosure with system execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation. (CVE-2019-9444)

  - In the netlink driver, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a race condition. This could lead to
    local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for
    exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-65025077 (CVE-2020-0066)

  - In uvc_scan_chain_forward of uvc_driver.c, there is a possible linked list corruption due to an unusual
    root cause. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution
    privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android
    kernelAndroid ID: A-111893654References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2020-0404)

  - In create_pinctrl of core.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could
    lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-140550171
    (CVE-2020-0427)

  - In blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter of blk-mq-tag.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking.
    This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-151939299
    (CVE-2020-0433)

  - An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10.
    Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka
    CID-d0c7feaf8767. (CVE-2020-12655)

  - The VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel through 5.6.13 mishandles attempts to access disabled memory
    space. (CVE-2020-12888)

  - In the Linux kernel before 5.4.16, a race condition in tty->disc_data handling in the slip and slcan line
    discipline could lead to a use-after-free, aka CID-0ace17d56824. This affects drivers/net/slip/slip.c and
    drivers/net/can/slcan.c. (CVE-2020-14416)

  - The rbd block device driver in drivers/block/rbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.8.9 used incomplete
    permission checking for access to rbd devices, which could be leveraged by local attackers to map or unmap
    rbd block devices, aka CID-f44d04e696fe. (CVE-2020-25284)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel where refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind() causing use-after-free
    which might lead to privilege escalations. (CVE-2020-25670)

  - A memory leak vulnerability was found in Linux kernel in llcp_sock_connect (CVE-2020-25672)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel where non-blocking socket in llcp_sock_connect() leads to leak
    and eventually hanging-up the system. (CVE-2020-25673)

  - In xfrm6_tunnel_free_spi of net/ipv6/xfrm6_tunnel.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper
    locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-168043318
    (CVE-2020-27066)

  - A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest
    when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into
    accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest. (CVE-2020-2732)

  - In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7, insufficient identifier checking
    in the LIO SCSI target code can be used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal
    in an XCOPY request, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker
    has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O operations are
    proxied via an attacker-selected backstore. (CVE-2020-28374)

  - A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13.
    drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID,
    aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24. (CVE-2020-29660)

  - A locking issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13.
    drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c allows a use-after-free attack against TIOCSPGRP, aka CID-54ffccbf053b.
    (CVE-2020-29661)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - A race condition in the Linux kernel before 5.6.2 between the VT_DISALLOCATE ioctl and closing/opening of
    ttys could lead to a use-after-free. (CVE-2020-36557)

  - A race condition in the Linux kernel before 5.5.7 involving VT_RESIZEX could lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference and general protection fault. (CVE-2020-36558)

  - IBM Power9 (AIX 7.1, 7.2, and VIOS 3.1) processors could allow a local user to obtain sensitive
    information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. IBM X-Force ID: 189296.
    (CVE-2020-4788)

  - Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information
    disclosure via adjacent access. (CVE-2021-0129)

  - In __hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers of hid-input.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to
    a heap buffer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution
    privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android
    kernelAndroid ID: A-173843328References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0512)

  - A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c.
    This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name
    space (CVE-2021-22555)

  - Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow
    an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. (CVE-2021-33098)

  - When sending malicous data to kernel by ioctl cmd FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO,kernel will write memory out of
    bounds. (CVE-2021-33655)

  - When setting font with malicous data by ioctl cmd PIO_FONT,kernel will write memory out of bounds.
    (CVE-2021-33656)

  - A flaw double-free memory corruption in the Linux kernel HCI device initialization subsystem was found in
    the way user attach malicious HCI TTY Bluetooth device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the
    system. This flaw affects all the Linux kernel versions starting from 3.13. (CVE-2021-3564)

  - A flaw was found in the 'Routing decision' classifier in the Linux kernel's Traffic Control networking
    subsystem in the way it handled changing of classification filters, leading to a use-after-free condition.
    This flaw allows unprivileged local users to escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat
    from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3715)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a
    privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the
    /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it
    can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms. (CVE-2021-3923)

  - In fs/eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege
    with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product:
    AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-204450605References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39634)

  - In gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show of configfs.c, there is a possible disclosure of kernel heap memory due to a
    race condition. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-160822094References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39648)

  - A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that
    allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with
    group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a
    certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive
    permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous
    CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS. (CVE-2021-4037)

  - A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size
    increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS
    filesystem otherwise not accessible to them. (CVE-2021-4155)

  - An information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c in the Linux
    Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information.
    (CVE-2022-0812)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernel's filesystem sub-
    component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2022-1184)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Atheros wireless adapter driver in the way a user
    forces the ath9k_htc_wait_for_target function to fail with some input messages. This flaw allows a local
    user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-1679)

  - In various methods of kernel base drivers, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a heap buffer
    overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-182388481References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20166)

  - Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-224546354References: Upstream kernel
    (CVE-2022-20368)

  - In verity_target of dm-verity-target.c, there is a possible way to modify read-only files due to a missing
    permission check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges
    needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid
    ID: A-234475629References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20572)

  - Dm-verity is used for extending root-of-trust to root filesystems. LoadPin builds on this property to
    restrict module/firmware loads to just the trusted root filesystem. Device-mapper table reloads currently
    allow users with root privileges to switch out the target with an equivalent dm-linear target and bypass
    verification till reboot. This allows root to bypass LoadPin and can be used to load untrusted and
    unverified kernel modules and firmware, which implies arbitrary kernel execution and persistence for
    peripherals that do not verify firmware updates. We recommend upgrading past commit
    4caae58406f8ceb741603eee460d79bacca9b1b5 (CVE-2022-2503)

  - It was discovered that the cls_route filter implementation in the Linux kernel would not remove an old
    filter from the hashtable before freeing it if its handle had the value 0. (CVE-2022-2588)

  - An issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and
    incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted
    IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured. (CVE-2022-2663)

  - An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel Intel's iSMT SMBus host controller
    driver in the way a user triggers the I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_DATA (with the ioctl I2C_SMBUS) with malicious input
    data. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. (CVE-2022-2873)

  - Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to
    cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14
    and later versions. (CVE-2022-29581)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet
    Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes.
    (CVE-2022-2964)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel implementation of proxied virtualized TPM devices. On a system where
    virtualized TPM devices are configured (this is not the default) a local attacker can create a use-after-
    free and create a situation where it may be possible to escalate privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-2977)

  - A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem)
    when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to
    potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read
    and copying it into a socket. (CVE-2022-3028)

  - The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are
    used. This occurs because of use of Algorithm 4 ('Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm') of RFC 6056.
    (CVE-2022-32296)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SGI GRU driver in the way the first
    gru_file_unlocked_ioctl function is called by the user, where a fail pass occurs in the
    gru_check_chiplet_assignment function. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate
    their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-3424)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init
    (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an
    unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data
    in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. (CVE-2022-34918)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this

    the function inet6_stream_ops/inet6_dgram_ops of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to
    race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211090 is the identifier
    assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3567)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb
    enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed)
    into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of
    service. (CVE-2022-3586)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this

    (CVE-2022-3629)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14. xfrm_expand_policies in
    net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c can cause a refcount to be dropped twice. (CVE-2022-36879)

  - nfqnl_mangle in net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because, in the case of an nf_queue verdict with a one-byte
    nfta_payload attribute, an skb_pull can encounter a negative skb->len. (CVE-2022-36946)

  - An incorrect read request flaw was found in the Infrared Transceiver USB driver in the Linux kernel. This
    issue occurs when a user attaches a malicious USB device. A local user could use this flaw to starve the
    resources, causing denial of service or potentially crashing the system. (CVE-2022-3903)

  - An issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race
    condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale
    TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs. (CVE-2022-39188)

  - drivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information
    from kernel memory because stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case.
    (CVE-2022-40768)

  - In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused
    by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. (CVE-2022-41218)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A missing lock when clearing
    sk_user_data can lead to a race condition and NULL pointer dereference. A local user could use this flaw
    to potentially crash the system causing a denial of service. (CVE-2022-4129)

  - roccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition
    and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a
    report->value is in progress. (CVE-2022-41850)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking
    configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action 'mirred') a local unprivileged user
    could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a
    retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition. (CVE-2022-4269)

  - mm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.7 has a use-after-free related to leaf anon_vma double reuse.
    (CVE-2022-42703)

  - drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-
    space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory. (CVE-2022-43750)

  - A flaw incorrect access control in the Linux kernel USB core subsystem was found in the way user attaches
    usb device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2022-4662)

  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows
    an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control
    configuration that is set up with 'tc qdisc' and 'tc class' commands. This affects qdisc_graft in
    net/sched/sch_api.c. (CVE-2022-47929)

  - A use after free vulnerability exists in the ALSA PCM package in the Linux Kernel.
    SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_{READ|WRITE}32 is missing locks that can be used in a use-after-free that can result
    in a priviledge escalation to gain ring0 access from the system user. We recommend upgrading past commit
    56b88b50565cd8b946a2d00b0c83927b7ebb055e (CVE-2023-0266)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network
    subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash. (CVE-2023-0394)

  - A memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel's human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a
    user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their
    privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-1073)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may
    occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could
    allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2023-1074)

  - In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the
    transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list
    -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2023-1095)

  - A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the
    way user detaching rc device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate
    their privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-1118)

  - Use After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege
    Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-
    after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this
    vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git
    commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2. (CVE-2023-1281)

  - A slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in
    drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur
    when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading
    to a denial of service. (CVE-2023-1380)

  - A data race flaw was found in the Linux kernel, between where con is allocated and con->sock is set. This
    issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing con->sock->sk in net/tipc/topsrv.c in the tipc
    protocol in the Linux kernel. (CVE-2023-1382)

  - cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes
    indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23454)

  - atm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition
    rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23455)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in
    the Linux Kernel. The message from user space is not checked properly before transferring into the device.
    This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2023-28328)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3. lib/seq_buf.c has a seq_buf_putmem_hex buffer
    overflow. (CVE-2023-28772)

  - A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Linux Kernel (Operating System) (affected version
    unknown). Affected by this vulnerability is some unknown processing of the component Cache Handler. There
    is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object
    with an alternative product. (CVE-2022-20565)
