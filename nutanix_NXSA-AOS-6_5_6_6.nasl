vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-6.5.6.6 advisory.

  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a
    buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings
    which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not
    a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar
    parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will
    additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for
    applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array
    by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using
    the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to
    assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for
    strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be
    printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the
    application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing
    can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been
    directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the
    certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the
    X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an
    application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL
    functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).
    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive
    plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2y). (CVE-2021-3712)

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

  - The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name
    types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different
    instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both
    GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a
    possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1)
    Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in
    an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp
    authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an
    attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if
    the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL
    then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a
    certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified.
    OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the -crl_download option which implements
    automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an
    unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of
    EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will
    accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.
    Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w). (CVE-2020-1971)

  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient
    to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
    decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.
    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS
    connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An
    attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
    trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number
    of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be
    able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. (CVE-2022-4304)

  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is
    primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may
    also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a
    new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the
    BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,
    the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this
    case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal
    pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then
    a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the
    internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call
    BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
    PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,
    SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
    i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL
    cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. (CVE-2023-0215)
