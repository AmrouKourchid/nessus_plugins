    Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE
    (component: Serialization). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 7u321, 8u311,
    11.0.13, 17.01; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.4 and 21.3.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability
    allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE,
    Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible
    data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
    Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes
